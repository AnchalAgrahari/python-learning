DATA STRUCTURE: a perticular way of Organizing and storing data.
linear dataStructure : accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to stor ass the element sequentily. like stack and queues
non-linear dataStructure : stored in a non-linear order . like tree and graphs

ABSTRACT DATATYPE : to simplify the process of solving the problem , we combine the dataStructure with theri problem and  we call this ADts. 
decleration of data 
decleration of operation
ADTs : Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, proritty queues,Binary Trees, Dictionary, Disjoint Sets(Union and Find), Hash table, Graphs
like stacks uses LIFO(Last In First Out) 

ALGORITHM : An algoritm is the step by step unambiguous instruction to solve the problem.
we have 2 criteria for judging the merits of the algorithm : 1: correctness , 2: efficiency 

ANALYSIS/GOAL  of Algorithim : helps to detremine which algo is more efficient mainly in term of time and space  factor but also in other( memory,developer effort etc)
RUNNING TIME ANALYSIS 

HOW TO COMPARE ALGO : 
        1. execution time?
        2. number of statement executed?
        3. ideal solution?
